## Introduction

A git plugin to make adherance to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0] easier, with its own plugin architecture for optional
version management of:

- [Keep a Changelog][Keep a CHANGELOG] [CHANGELOG.md] file
- [NPM] [package.json] file
- ...

See [PLUGINS.md] for a description of plugins.

### Semantic versioning

[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0] is a scheme for versioning, which includes 3 parts e.g. ```3.2.1``` the components of which
are:

  - Major: Used only for backward compatible breaking changes, i.e. when we have an all new theme etc.
  - Minor: Used for normal development, i.e. creating a new template
  - Bug fixes

## Installation

Via git clone.

``` bash
(git clone https://github.com/markchalloner/git-semver.git && sudo git-semver/install.sh)
```

The installer installs git-semver into the first of the following directories that exist and are in the path:

- $HOME/.local/bin
- $HOME/bin
- /usr/local/bin
- /usr/local/bin
- /usr/bin
- /bin

In Linux, OSX and Windows Cygwin the installer will create a symlink. In Windows MinGW creates a stub instead.

The installer will not overwrite any existing [configuration](#configuration) or [plugins][PLUGINS.md].

## Usage

### Get latest version tag

``` bash
git semver get
```

Will return empty if no version has been created.

### Create a new version tag

Versions are created as tags and are generated using:

``` bash
git semver [major|minor|patch|next]
```

#### Patch (Next)

Increment the patch component (0.1.0 -> 0.1.1)

``` bash
git semver patch|next
```

If no version has been created, the initial version will be: **0.1.0**

#### Minor

Increment the minor component (0.1.0 -> 0.2.0)

``` bash
git semver minor
```

If no version has been created, the initial version will be: **0.1.0**

#### Major

Increment the major component (0.1.0 -> 1.0.0)

``` bash
git semver major
```

If no version has been created, the initial version will be: **1.0.0**

### Help

Run git semver with no arguments to see usage

``` bash
git semver [help]
```

## Configuration

Git-semver will check for a configuration file in the following locations (and use the one that exists):

- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.git-semver/config`
- `$HOME/.git-semver/config`

Git-semver will default to `$HOME/.git-semver/config` if no configuration file is found.

An example configuration file with the default settings can be found at [config.example].

## Updates

Updates can be done using git. Change to the cloned directory and run a git pull:

```
(cd $(dirname $(readlink $(which git-semver))) && git status)
```

## Uninstallation

### Automatically

Via uninstaller in clone directory. Navigate to your original clone directory and run:

``` bash
sudo git-semver/uninstall.sh [-p|--purge]
```

The purge switch will additionally remove the configuration directory.

### Manually

git-semver is installed by placing a symlink/stub in one of the bin directories in the path.

- ${HOME}/.local/bin
- ${HOME}/bin
- /usr/local/bin
- /usr/bin
- /bin

It can be deleted easily:

``` bash
sudo rm $(which git-semver)
```

The configuration directory can be removed with:

``` bash
rm -rf ${HOME}/.git-semver
```
