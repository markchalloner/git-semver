## Introduction

git-semver can run its own plugins. These are self contained executable files that live under either:


Location                        | Contains
------------------------------- | ------------------------
`./.git-semver/plugins`         | Project plugins (added and committed) which run on just the current git project
`${HOME}/.git-semver/plugins/`  | User plugins which run on all git projects                

Plugin can stop a tag being generated (for example if a version file does not exist).

See [Contributing](#contributing) for detail on creating a plugin or take a look at the [example plugin] or any of the [real plugins](#plugins).

## Installation

Plugins can be installed by copying them into `.git-semver/plugins/` in either the project or under the user's home directory.

## Plugins

### Keep A Changelog - [`keepachangelog.sh`]

A changelog is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project.

git-semver uses changelog convention from [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com). A changelog lists notable changes for each release of a project.

For a new version to be generated, a changelog must have already been commited which includes:

- Details of the version (including _version number_ and _date_)
- A list of changes under one or more of the headings:
  - **Added** for new features.
  - **Changed** for changes in existing functionality.
  - **Deprecated** for once-stable features removed in upcoming releases.
  - **Removed** for deprecated features removed in this release.
  - **Fixed** for any bug fixes.
  - **Security** to invite users to upgrade in case of vulnerabilities.
- An updated **unreleased** link at the bottom of the file
- A version link at the bottom of the file

``` markdown
## [{{new version}}] - {{YYYY-MM-DD}}

See [Keep a CHANGELOG] for full details.

### NPM `package.json` - [`npmpackagejson.sh`]

The [`package.json`] file is used by [NPM], typically for [Node.js] applications, however can also be used in other projects where development tools (such as runners or builders like [Gulp] or [Grunt]) or languages like [CoffeeScript] or [SASS] are required.

`package.json` includes a version property, which `npmpackagejson.sh` will check:

``` json
{
   ...
   "version": "3.2.1",
   ...
}
```

## Contributing

A plugin can be any executable file stored in `.git-semver/plugins/`.

### Description

If the first parameter is `--about`, then the plugin should print a one-line description of itself, and exit `0`.

### Parameters

The plugins must take the positional parameters:

Parameter             | Value
--------------------- | -------------------------
`version_new`         | Version git-semver is attempting to add
`version_current`     | Current version the project is at (or blank if no version)
`git_hash`            | The current full SHA-1 hash
`git_branch`          | The current local branch
`git_root`            | The full path of the git project

All or none of these may be used.

### Exit codes

The plugin must exit with one of the codes:

Exit Code   | Meaning
---------   | -------
`0`         | No error
`111`       | Warning: continue processing plugins and apply version
`112`       | Error: continue processing plugins (to allow other generated errors) but stop before applying version tag
`113`       | Fatal error: stop immediately

Any other codes are ignored, and will cause git-semver to continue processing plugins and apply a version.

### Output

Plugins can print anything to `stdout` or `stderr`. This will be formatted and displayed by git-semver.

### Pull requests

Please contribute your plugin by opening a pull request.
